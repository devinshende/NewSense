Natural Language Processing (NLP) combines the academic disciplines of computer science, linguistics and artificial intelligence to develop computer programs with the ability to understand text and spoken words. This rapidly growing field provides key capabilities for many areas of artificial intelligence. Advances in NLP mean that computer programs can now be developed which understand, generate and learn from human speech. An equally important part of studying NLP lies in developing algorithms, methods and tools for the analysis of both text and speech.

Our flexible 15-18 month in-person program offers an intensive and effective way to immerse yourself in the theory and develop the practical skills needed for a career in this important field. This is a highly specialized program. All our courses are designed for – and are exclusive to – only NLP students and are tailored for the needs of the sector. The program emphasizes practical proficiency in applying the relevant skills through courses focusing on core algorithms in Natural Language Processing, machine learning, and data science and analytics. This is a STEM designated degree program for STEM-OPT extension.
